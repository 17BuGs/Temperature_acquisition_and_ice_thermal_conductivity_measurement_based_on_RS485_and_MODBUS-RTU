# Temperature_acquisition_and_ice_thermal_conductivity_measurement_based_on_RS485_and_MODBUS-RTU
Based on RS-485 interface and MODBUS-RTU communication protocol, real-time reading and writing data of the four-channel temperature digital reader can be realized at the same time to draw the sample temperature change curve, calculate the thermal conductivity, and draw the thermal conductivity curve.
